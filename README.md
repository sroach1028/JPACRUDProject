### About
This project is a dynamic web application that allows a user to Create, Read, Update, or Delete information related to Pokemon. The information is managed in a MySql database using the Java Persistence API (JPA) and Spring Boot framework.
The user can view and manipulate data for individual Pokemon, like their Name, Type, and Weakness.

The front-end display uses Bootstrap templates and CSS styling.
